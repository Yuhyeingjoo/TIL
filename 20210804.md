# Embedded system architecture.
## Introduction
	- Every embedded system has an architecture, which is a set of representations of elements and their relationships.
	- It is useful to unserstand all fo the major elements.
## Embedded Hardware
	- CPU : the master processor.
	- Memory : where the system's software is stored.
	- Input device
	- Output device
	- Data pathway/bus : interconnects the other components, providing a high way for data to travel on from on component to another.
-- This five categories are base for von Neumann model.
- Powering 
	- Power is the rate that energy is expended or work is performed.
	- P = VI
	- The AC current for transmitting long distances.
	- The DC current for activating the power. 
	- DC 전류가 방향과 크기가 일정하기 때문에 전자제품의 전류원으로 적합하고, AC 전류는 송전시에 손실이 적기 때문에 송전 매개로 적합하다.
	- AC/DC convertor 
- Conductors, Insulators, and Semiconductors
	- Conductors : 도체, Valance electrons are not closely associated with atoms. 전자가 쉽게 이동함.
	- Insulators : Four or more Valance electrons, 전자가 쉽게 이동하지 않음. => 전류가 흐르지 않는다.
	- Semiconductor : 반도체, silocon.
- Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors
	- Resisitor : Conductor device, increase resistences, 
	- V = IR => Can control the current and the voltage.
	- Capacitor :
