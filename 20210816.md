# Deadlock detector

- My deadlock detector program detects a deadlock generated in a program whose name is given to the deadlock detector via cmd argument .
- Also, it predicts Mutexes at risk of potentially deadlock.
- First, I override "pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t * m) " and  "pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t * m)".
- When these two function execute, information about the lock are sended through FIFO to detector. 
- The detector draws a mutex lock graph and updates the graph everytime it receives lock information (redardless of lock or unlock information).
- After updating the graph, the detector search the graph and find a cycle.
- If it finds a cycle, the program prints out the line number of the deadlock genering function.(By using "backtrace()" and "addr2line()").
